## Proxy to a web service

Proxyflare can send incoming traffic on your domain to anywhere on the internet. The route below sends traffic on `https://flaregun.net/example` to `https://example.com`.

For example, traffic on `https://flaregun.net/example/page` gets sent to `https://example.com/page`.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const apiRoute = {
  from: { pattern: "flaregun.net/api/*" },
  to: { url: "my-api.com" },
}

const routes = [apiRoute]
```

Notice the wildcard pathname in `from.pattern`. Proxyflare works with absolute pathnames like `flaregun.net/my-form` and wildcard pathnames like `flaregun.net/api/*`.
In the wildcard example, traffic on `/api` and `/api/users` is proxied.

:::info Note

<i>https:</i> is assumed if a protocol is not present in `to.url`

:::

The following route configuration sends traffic on `flaregun.net/api/*` to the service listening on `flaregun.net:8787`.

For example, incoming requests to `https://flaregun.net/api/users` and `https://*www*.flaregun.net/api/users` are both sent to `https://flaregun.net:8787/users`.
To disable loose matching of `www` and `root domain` traffic, set `strictRootSubdomain = true`.

For example, traffic on `https://flaregun.net/example/page` gets sent to `https://example.com/page`.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const apiRoute = {
  // optional field to describe the route
  description: "send my api traffic to port 8787",
  from: {
    pattern: "flaregun.net/api/*",
    strictRootSubdomain: false,
  },
  to: { url: "flaregun.net:8787" },
  headers: {
    // request headers to pass along with the proxied request
    request: { Authorization: "Bearer token" },
  },
}

const routes = [apiRoute]
```
