## Redirect to another location

The route below redirects traffic on `flaregun.net/redirect` to `example.com` because it includes a 300-level `statusCode`. A route may include any valid `statusCode`
such as `404` but `statusCode` is most useful for redirects.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const redirectRoute = {
  from: { pattern: "flaregun.net/redirect" },
  to: {
    url: "example.com",
    statusCode: 301,
  },
}

const routes = [redirectRoute]
```
