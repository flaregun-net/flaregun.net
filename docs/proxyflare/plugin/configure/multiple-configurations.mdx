## Configure multiple routes

Proxyflare works with multiple route configurations. Read on to learn about how Proxyflare handles a request to `https://flaregun.net/api/users/john` with the following configuration.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "flaregun.net/api/*" },
    // rest of route config
  },
  {
    from: { pattern: "flaregun.net/api/users/*" },
    // rest of route config
  },
]
```

:::warning Spoiler

The latter route wins because it has a higher pathname specificity!
