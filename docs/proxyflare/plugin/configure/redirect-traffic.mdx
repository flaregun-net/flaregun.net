Proxyflare can redirect traffic on absolute or wildcard pathnames on your domain to other places on the internet.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const redirectRoute: Route = {
  from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/redirect" },
  to: {
    url: "example.com",
    statusCode: 301,
  },
}

const routes = [redirectRoute]
```

This route redirects traffic on `proxyflare.works/redirect` to `example.com` because it contains a `3xx` `statusCode`. Providing a `statusCode` is useful for redirects and if you want to hard code the response status on a route.
