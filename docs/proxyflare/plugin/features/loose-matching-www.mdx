In some cases, you may want a `Route` to match incoming requests to the root domain and the corresponding `www` subdomain.

Instead of creating a separate `Route` for each one, we can supply `alsoMatchWWWSubdomain` to match both root and www subdomain requests. This `Route` will send both `proxyflare.works/api/*` and `www.proxyflare.works/api/*` to `Route["to.url"]`.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/*", alsoMatchWWWSubdomain: true },
    to: { url: "ec2-5-55-555-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8787" },
  },
]
```
