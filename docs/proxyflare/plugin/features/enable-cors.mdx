Proxyflare includes support for [cross origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

## Configuration

Provide your desired settings in the `Route["to.cors"]` field. Refer to the [`CORSOptions` documentation](http://localhost:3000/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/reference/type-definitions#corsoptions) for more information.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/*" },
    to: {
      url: "ec2-5-55-555-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8787",
      cors: {
        origin: true,
        methods: "*",
        exposedHeaders: [],
        allowedHeaders: [],
        credentials: true,
        maxAge: 3600,
      },
    },
  },
]
```

## Testing CORS

There are many tools to test your CORS configuration. We recommend [codehappy.dev](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/).
