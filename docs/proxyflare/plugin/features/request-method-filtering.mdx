In some cases, you may want to create a `Route` that only matches certain request methods. Let's say we're serving a static response that should only be available on a `GET` request.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes = [
  {
    from: {
      pattern: "proxyflare.works/robots.txt",
      methods: ["GET"],
    },
    to: {
      text: "User-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /nogooglebot/\nUser-agent: *\nAllow: /\n",
    },
  },
]
```

Any valid HTTP request method can be added to `Route["from.methods"]` to prevent it from matching requests with unlisted methods.
