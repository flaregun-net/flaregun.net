Proxyflare makes it easy to add HTTP headers to a `Route`.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/*" },
    to: { url: "ec2-5-55-555-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8787" },
    headers: {
      request: {
        "some-request-header": "header-value",
        "another-request-header": "header-value",
      },
      response: {
        "some-response-header": "header-value",
      },
    },
  },
]
```

When an incoming request matches a `Route`, any configured request and response headers are added to `ProxiedRequest` and `ProxiedResponse`, respectively.

:::caution

A common `Configuration` error is accidently nesting `headers` inside the `to` node. When setting `headers`, ensure it is set at the top level of your `Route`, or use Typescript to catch this pitfall automatically!
