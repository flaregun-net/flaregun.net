For website routes, Proxyflare includes support for [Early Hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103) to improve load times by up to 30%.

Please refer to [this excellent article](https://nitropack.io/blog/post/early-hints) for more information on how early hints can be used to supercharge your website.

## Configuration

Set `Route["to.website.earlyHints"]=true`, early hints are sent for all script tags, stylesheets, and images on your website.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/docs/*" },
    to: {
      url: "https://docusaurus-on-proxyflare.vercel.app",
      website: {
        mode: "spa",
        earlyHints: true,
      },
    },
  },
]
```

For more fine-grained support, provide an array with the following options.

```ts
const routes = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/docs/*" },
    to: {
      url: "https://docusaurus-on-proxyflare.vercel.app",
      website: {
        mode: "spa",
        earlyHints: [
          "provide-images",
          "provide-stylesheets",
          "provide-scripts",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
]
```

If provided, `provide-stylesheets` and `provide-scripts` will send early hints for all stylesheets and scripts on your website, respectively.

`provide-images` will provide early hints for any image tagged with a `data-early-hints` attribute. In the markup below, early hints will be sent for the first image, but not the second:

```html
<div>
  <img data-early-hints="true" src="/cheetah.jpg" />
  <img src="/fat-cat.jpg" />
</div>
```
