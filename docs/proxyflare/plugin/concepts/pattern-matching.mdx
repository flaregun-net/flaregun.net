## Request matching basics

This article descibes how Proxyflare matches an incoming request to a `Route` in your `Configuration` using the concept of _pathname score_.

Let's test your intuition with a basic setup.

Proxyflare is installed on _proxyflare.works_ with the `Configuration` below and a request arrives â€” `GET https://proxyflare.works/api/users/john`.

Each `Route` matches the incoming request. Which `Route` does Proxyflare run?

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
// incoming request: GET https://proxyflare.works/api/users/john

const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/*" },
    ...
  },
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/users/*" },
    ...
  },
]
```

:::info Answer

The second route runs! But why?

Proxyflare sorts each `Route` by the pathname score of `Route["from.pattern"]`. The second route runs because it contains more pathname parts.

:::

## How pathname score works

If an incoming request matches multiple `Routes`, Proxyflare runs the `Route` with the higher pathname score. Every `Route` is assigned a pathname score using the value of `Route["from.pattern"]`.

### Assigning pathname depth

Pathname score increases with _pathname depth_. The more forward-slash `/` separated path slugs in `Route["from.pattern"]`, the higher the rank.

For example, `Route["from.pattern"]=ex.com/shallow/deeper` has a pathname depth of two with path slugs `shallow` and `deeper`.

| Pathname depth | Pathname score | `Route["from.pattern"]`    |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 3              | 3              | ex.com/shallow/deeper/deep |
| 2              | 2              | ex.com/shallow/deeper      |
| 1              | 1              | ex.com/shallow             |

### Breaking pathname depth ties

Given two patterns with the same pathname depth, rank is allocated by _last slug length_.
For example, given `Route["from.pattern"]=ex.com/shallow/deep` and `Route["from.pattern"]=ex.com/shallow/deeper`, the latter wins because `deeper` is longer slug than `deep`.

| Pathname depth | Last slug length | Pathname score | `Route["from.pattern"]` |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2              | 6                | 2              | ex.com/shallow/deeper   |
| 2              | 4                | 1              | ex.com/shallow/deep     |

Proxyflare supports wildcard patterns for matching subrequests on a particular pathname. Some pathname patterns would be identical when wildcards are removed. In this case, _pattern type_ is used to break the tie:

1. Absolute path `ex.com/shallow`
2. Inline wildcard `ex.com/shallow*`
3. Slash wildcard `ex.com/shallow/*`

| Pathname depth | Last slug length | Pattern type | Pathname score | `Route["from.pattern"]` |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1              | 7                | absolute     | 3              | ex.com/shallow          |
| 1              | 7                | inline \*    | 2              | ex.com/shallow\*        |
| 1              | 7                | slash \*     | 1              | ex.com/shallow/\*       |

In other words, if multiple `Routes` are identical after wildcards are removed, the absolute path outranks the inline wildcard and the inline wildcard outranks the slash wildcard.

:::warning TLDR

The `Route` with the highest pathname depth wins.

If multiple routes have the same pathname depth, the longer last path slug wins.

If multiple routes have the same last path slug after removing wildcards, absolute paths beat inline wildcards and inline wildcards beat slash wildcards.

The following table shows this ranking strategy with complex `Route["from.pattern"]`s listed by pathname score.
The last column shows an incoming request that would match each pattern.

| Pathname score | `Route["from.pattern"]`  | Example Matching Request        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 14             | ex.com/shallow/deeper    | ex.com/shallow/deeper           |
| 13             | ex.com/shallow/deeper\*  | ex.com/shallow/deeper-in        |
| 12             | ex.com/shallow/deeper/\* | ex.com/shallow/deeper/down      |
| 11             | ex.com/shallow/deep      | ex.com/shallow/deep             |
| 10             | ex.com/shallow/deep\*    | ex.com/shallow/deep-in          |
| 9              | ex.com/shallow/deep/\*   | ex.com/shallow/deep/down        |
| 8              | ex.com/shallower         | ex.com/shallower                |
| 7              | ex.com/shallower\*       | ex.com/shallower-yet            |
| 6              | ex.com/shallower/\*      | ex.com/shallower/still          |
| 5              | ex.com/shallow           | ex.com/shallow                  |
| 4              | ex.com/shallow\*         | ex.com/shallow-lakes            |
| 3              | ex.com/shallow/\*        | ex.com/shallow/water            |
| 2              | ex.com/                  | ex.com/                         |
| 1              | ex.com/\*                | ex.com/anything-still-unmatched |

:::info Tip

Set the `Configuration["global.debug"]` flag to attach a `x-proxyflare-proxied-pathname` response header to matched requests. This [debug header](/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/tutorials/debugging-proxyflare/) contains the matched pathname.
