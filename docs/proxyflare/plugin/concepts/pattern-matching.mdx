## How Proxyflare matches routes

Proxyflare works with any number of routes by ordering them by pathname specificity of `Route[from.pattern]`. This section explains how pathname specificity is and how understand how Proxyflare prioritizes route Read on to learn about how Proxyflare handles a request to `https://proxyflare.works/api/users/john` with the following configuration.

```ts
// functions/[[path]].ts
const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/*" },
    // rest of route config
  },
  {
    from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/api/users/*" },
    // rest of route config
  },
]
```

:::warning Spoiler

The latter route wins because it has a higher pathname specificity!

:::

In the example above, the second route is matched for a request to `https://proxyflare.works/api/users/john`, but why? When Proxyflare runs, it sorts `routes` based on the pathname specificity of `Route["from.pattern"]`.

## How Proxyflare matches routes

Pathname specificity increases with pathname depth. The more forward-slash `/` separated parts in the pathname, the higher the specificity. For example, `from.pattern=ex.com/a/b/c` has a pathname depth of three.

Given two patterns with the same pathname depth, the one with the the longer trailing slug wins.
For example, given `from.pattern=ex.com/a/b/c*` and `from.pattern=ex.com/a/b/cccc*`, the latter wins.

For patterns that would be identical if wildcards were removed, rank is allocated in order of:

1. Absolute path `ex.com/a`
2. Inline wildcard `ex.com/a*`
3. Slash wildcard `ex.com/a/*`

The table below shows this strategy on a list of routes with complex `Route["from.pattern"]`s listed by pathname specificity.
The last column shows an incoming request that would match each pattern.

| Specificity | `Route["from.pattern"]`  | Example Matching Request        |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 14          | ex.com/shallow/deeper    | ex.com/shallow/deeper           |
| 13          | ex.com/shallow/deeper\*  | ex.com/shallow/deeper-in        |
| 12          | ex.com/shallow/deeper/\* | ex.com/shallow/deeper/down      |
| 11          | ex.com/shallow/deep      | ex.com/shallow/deep             |
| 10          | ex.com/shallow/deep\*    | ex.com/shallow/deep-in          |
| 9           | ex.com/shallow/deep/\*   | ex.com/shallow/deep/down        |
| 8           | ex.com/shallower         | ex.com/shallower                |
| 7           | ex.com/shallower\*       | ex.com/shallower-yet            |
| 6           | ex.com/shallower/\*      | ex.com/shallower/still          |
| 5           | ex.com/shallow           | ex.com/shallow                  |
| 4           | ex.com/shallow\*         | ex.com/shallow-lakes            |
| 3           | ex.com/shallow/\*        | ex.com/shallow/water            |
| 2           | ex.com/                  | ex.com/                         |
| 1           | ex.com/\*                | ex.com/anything-still-unmatched |

:::info Tip

Set the `global.debug` configuration variable to inspect the the `x-proxyflare-matched-pathname` response header for the matched pathname.
