Proxyflare moves traffic around your domain using `Routes`. A `Route` sends traffic to another service on your domain or elsewhere on the internet by generating a `ProxiedRequest` and handling the proxied response.

The fundamental building blocks of a `Route` are `Route["from"]` and `Route["to"]`.

`Route["from"]` tells Proxyflare to use (or _match_) the `Route` for traffic _from_ the selected part of your domain.

`Route["to"]` tells Proxyflare where to send the matched traffic _to_, which is usually another URL.
The following articles outline some Proxyflare use cases.
