Proxyflare moves traffic around your domain by trying to match incoming requests against a `Route` list in your `Configuration`. A `Route` can send traffic to another service on your domain or anywhere else on the internet.

Each `Route` tells Proxyflare which incoming traffic to match and where to send it. When a `Route` is matched, Proxyflare handles the request by generating a `ProxiedRequest` and handling the `ProxiedResponse`.

The fundamental building blocks of a `Route` are `Route["from"]` and `Route["to"]`.

## Route\["from"\]

`Route["from"]` tells Proxyflare to match the `Route` against traffic _from_ the selected part of your domain.

> "Send traffic _from_ this part of my domain..."

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    from: {
      pattern: "proxyflare.works/hello",
    },
    ...
  },
]
```

## Route\["to"\]

`Route["to"]` tells Proxyflare where to send the matched traffic _to_, which is normally another URL on your domain or elsewhere on the internet.
The following articles outline some Proxyflare use cases.

> "...to this URL anywhere on the internet."

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    ...
    to: {
      url: "https://example.com",
    },
  },
]
```

:::warning TLDR

> Proxyflare: "Send traffic from the `Route["from"]` part of my domain to the `Route["to"]` location on the internet."

:::

## Putting it all together

> "Send traffic from `proxyflare.works/hello` to `https://example.com`"

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    from: {
      pattern: "proxyflare.works/hello",
    },
    to: {
      url: "https://example.com",
    },
  },
]
```
