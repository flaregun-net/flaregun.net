:::info Powered by Typescript

For Typescript users, Proxyflare for Pages comes with type definitions and in-editor documentation.

:::

## Configuration

The `Configuration` type:

```ts
export type Configuration = {
  global?: {
    /**
     * Disable Proxyflare without uninstalling it.
     *
     * @defaultValue `false`
     */
    disable?: boolean
    /**
     * Enable `debug` to attach the following debug headers to Proxyflare responses.  Make sure to disable `debug` when you are done configuring Proxyflare.
     *
     * `x-proxyflare: "running"` signals that Proxyflare is installed
     *
     * `x-proxyflare-error: string` describes an error if it occured, usually if the provided configuration is incorrect
     *
     * `x-proxyflare-matched-index: number | "none"` is a zero-indexed route that was matched to the request or "none"
     *
     * `x-proxyflare-proxied-path: "string"` is the pathname of the proxied request
     *
     * @defaultValue `false`
     */
    debug?: boolean
  }
  routes: Route[]
}
```

## Route

A `Route` type:

```ts
export type Route = {
  /**
   * A brief description the purpose of the route
   */
  description?: string
  from: {
    /**
     * The [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name#Example) to match against incoming traffic to determine if the route should be proxied by Proxyflare. May be an absolute or wildcard url.
     *
     * {@link Route.alsoMatchWWWSubdomain | See the `alsoMatchWWWSubdomain` option for additional configuration}
     *
     * {@link Route.stripFromPath | See the `stripFromPath` option for additional configuration}
     *
     * @example
     * Request: `https://admin.a.com/api`
     * from.pattern: `admin.a.com/api/*`
     * ‚úÖ MATCH
     *
     * Request: `https://admin.a.com/api/users`

     * ‚úÖ MATCH
     *
     * Request: `https://admin.a.com/absolute/subpath`
     * from.pattern: `admin.a.com/absolute`
     * ‚ùå NOT MATCHED
     */
    pattern: string
    /**

     *
     * @defaultValue `true`

     * to.url: `b.com`
     * -> proxies to `b.com/api/b`

     *
     * @defaultValue `false`
     *

    /**
     * Most websites make additional requests for stylesheets, images, and other static content required to render, format, and populate the page. Enumerate resource requests to tell Proxyflare to match them to your route.
     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * Resources a couple important caveats. Proxyflare does its best to route traffic, but if two website have identical static resource folders, all it can do is guess.
     *
     * Take the case where two websites both have `to.website.resources:["a.com/images/*"]`. On an request for `a.com/images/cat.jpg`, Proxyflare sends a request to both websites for the resource, and whichever one responds first wins.  This can be problematic in the case where both sites contain identical resources. For example, `logo.jpg` for one website might render on the other site!
     *
     * The recommended solution is to disambiguate the resources for each website. For example, change the images directory of the first website to `images-a` and the second to `images-b`. Then, Proxyflare will know exactly where to send traffic for each website.
     *
     * @example
     * Request: `a.com/images/its-morbin-time.jpg`
     * from.pattern: `a.com/my-site/*`
     * to.url: `b.com`
     * to.website.resources: `["a.com/images/*"]`
     * ‚úÖ Proxies traffic on `a.com/images/*` to `b.com`
     *
     * @example
     * Request: `a.com/static/lib/jquery.js`
     * from.pattern: `a.com/my-site/*`
     * to.url: `b.com`
     * to.website.resources: `["a.com/images/*", "a.com/static/lib/jquery.js"]`
     * ‚úÖ Proxies the jquery script to `b.com`
