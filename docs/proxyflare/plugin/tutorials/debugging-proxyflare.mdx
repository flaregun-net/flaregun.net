So you deployed your website deployed on Cloudflare Pages, installed Proxyflare, set up a `Route`, deployed a new build, and...nothing. Don't worry, we have you covered. Let's figure out what's going on with your `Configuration`.

## We <3 Typescript

If you're using Typescript, Proxyflare includes [robust type definitions](/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/reference/type-definitions) to help diagnose `Configuration` problems before your code ships.

## Using Debug Mode

Enable Debug Mode to learn how Proxyflare is operating on traffic and whether it is throwing an error.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
import proxyflare from "@flaregun-net/proxyflare-for-pages"

const routes: Route[] = []

export const onRequest: PagesFunction[] = [
  (context) =>
    proxyflare({
      config: {
        // debug mode is enabled
        global: { debug: true },
        routes,
      },
    })(context),
]
```

When Debug Mode is on, Proxyflare appends diagnostic response headers to incoming traffic. The video below demonstrates how to find these headers in your browser's **Developer Tools > Network** tab.

<div className="video-frame">
  <video controls>
    <source src="/videos/inspect-debug-headers.webm" />
  </video>
  <p>
    We enabled Debug Mode to attach useful diagnostics to the response headers
    of our proxied traffic.
  </p>
</div>

In Debug Mode, the following headers are appended to `ProxiedResponse`.

> `x-proxyflare: "running"` signals that Proxyflare is installed and operational on your domain

> `x-proxyflare-error: string` describes an error if it occured, usually because of a configuration issue

> `x-proxyflare-matched-index: number | "none"` is a zero-indexed `Route` that matched the request or "none"

> `x-proxyflare-matched-pathname: string` is the pathname of the matched `Route["from.pattern"]`

> `x-proxyflare-proxied-pathname: string` is the pathname of the `ProxiedRequest`

:::caution

Make sure to disable Debug Mode when you are done debugging to avoid exposing potentially sensitive proxy location information.

### Practical debugging in Debug Mode

If your `Configuration` seems broken:

1. Enable Debug Mode by setting `Configuration["global.debug"] = true`
2. Deploy your change
   - In your Cloudflare dashboard, _confirm the deployment was successful_
3. Once deployed, navigate to your website and open your browser's **Developer Tools > Network**
4. In the Network panel, open the **Search** window
   - In Chrome, press `cmd + f` on Mac or `ctrl + f` on Windows
   - In Firefox, press `cmd + shift + f` on Mac or `ctrl + shift + f` on Windows
5. In the search bar, type `x-proxyflare` and press Enter
   - You should see something like this
     ![Search for x-proxyflare](/img/debug-mode-search-x-proxyflare.png)

With this information,

- We can confirm Proxyflare is properly installed and running on our domain
  - If you do not see `x-proxyflare: running`, refer to the [Common installation issues](#fixing-installation-issues) section
- We can confirm Proxyflare is not throwing an error because `x-proxyflare-error` is absent

If `x-proxyflare-error: <error message>` is present, carefully inspect the error message to diagnose the issue in your `Configuration`. The error message might look something like this:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "0": {
      "to": {
        "website": {
          "mode": {
            "_errors": [
              "Invalid literal value, expected true",
              "Invalid literal value, expected \"spa\""
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While the formatting is somewhat cryptic, we can deduce the error is in `Route[0]["to.website"]`. Let's look at our `Configuration`.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    from: { pattern: `${host}/docs/*` },
    to: {
      url: "https://docusaurus-on-proxyflare.vercel.app/",
      website: {
        mode: false,
        resources: [`${host}/docs/assets/*`],
      },
    },
  },
]
```

Oops! Referring to Proxyflare's [type definitions](/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/reference/type-definitions#route), we see that `Route["to.website"]: true | "spa"`, not `false`.

### Fixing installation issues

Proxyflare is compatible with websites deployed on Cloudflare Pages. If your website isn't on Cloudflare Pages, Proxyflare won't work. However, it might be easier than you think to switch to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/). This website is deployed on Cloudflare Pages and it was really easy!

If your website is already on Cloudflare Pages, carefully follow the instructions in the [Plug In section](/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/getting-started/#plug-in). Ensure the file containing your Proxyflare configuration is named is exactly as instructed because Cloudflare Pages uses the filename internally for proper routing.

Once you've double checked your set up, make sure you deploy a new version of your website, and that the deployment succeeded. If you're fairly certain you're set up and in Debug Mode but still don't see `x-proxyflare="running"`, drop us a message in Discord and we'll help figure out what's going on.
