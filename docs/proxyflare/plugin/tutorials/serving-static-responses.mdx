Proxyflare can serve static responses from any part of your domain.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const robotsFile: Route = {
  from: {
    pattern: "proxyflare.works/robots.txt",
    methods: ["GET"],
  },
  to: {
    text: "User-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /nogooglebot/\nUser-agent: *\nAllow: /\n",
  },
}

const routes = [robotsFile]
```

In the above `robotsFile`, Proxyflare serves the content in `Route["to.text"]` on `GET proxyflare.works/robots.txt`. Note that `Route["from.methods"]` defines which HTTP methods will trigger the route.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const manifestFile: Route = {
  from: {
    pattern: "proxyflare.works/manifest.json",
    methods: ["GET"],
  },
  to: {
    text: '{"$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/web-manifest-combined.json", "name": "Proxyflare Works!"}',
  },
  headers: {
    response: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  },
}

const routes = [manifestFile]
```

In the `manifestFile` route, Proxyflare serves a `manifest.json` file to describe different parts of your internet property in a JSON response.

:::caution File size considerations

Please limit the size of text files served by Proxyflare to avoid exceeding [Workers file size limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size).
