Proxyflare can proxy traffic to your Cloudflare R2 bucket from any part of your domain.

If you aren't familiar with R2, it's Cloudflare's object storage solution — analagous to Amazon S3 — but affordable and way faster. To learn more about Cloudflare R2, refer to the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

## Bucket visibility

R2 buckets are private and can only be accessed using an
[R2 API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?account=r2/overview/api-tokens). You can make your bucket public by setting the bucket visibility in the [R2 dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?account=r2/overview). Proxyflare supports proxying traffic to both public and private buckets.

## Proxy a public bucket

If your bucket is already public, you may proxy it using the common `Route["to.url"]` syntax.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const publicR2BucketRoute: Route = {
  from: {
    pattern: "proxyflare.works/cat-pics/*",
  },
  to: {
    url: "https://pub-ec6768.r2.dev",
  },
}

const routes = [publicR2BucketRoute]
```

## Proxy a private bucket

If your bucket is private, you may proxy traffic to it using `Route["to.r2Bucket"]` configuration.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const privateR2BucketRoute: Route = {
  from: {
    pattern: "proxyflare.works/cat-pics/*",
  },
  to: {
    r2Bucket: {
      accountId: env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID,
      accessKeyId: env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      secretAccessKey: env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
      bucketName: env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,
    },
  },
}

const routes = [privateR2BucketRoute]
```

Populate `env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `env.R2_BUCKET_NAME` with the corresponding information from your account and [R2 API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?account=r2/overview/api-tokens).

:::caution Protect your secrets

Never hardcode your R2 secrets directly into your `Configuration`. Instead, use [environment variables](/docs/latest/proxyflare/plugin/tutorials/using-environment-variables) to safely protect your sensitive information.
