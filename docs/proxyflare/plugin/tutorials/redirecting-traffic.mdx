Proxyflare can redirect traffic from absolute or wildcard pathnames on your domain to other places.

```ts title="functions/_middleware.ts"
const redirectRoute: Route = {
  from: { pattern: "proxyflare.works/redirect" },
  to: {
    url: "example.com",
    // permanently redirect traffic to example.com
    statusCode: 301,
  },
}

const routes = [redirectRoute]
```

This route redirects traffic on `proxyflare.works/redirect` to `example.com` because it contains a `3xx` `statusCode`.

Providing a `statusCode` is useful for redirects or any time you want to lock the response status code on a `Route`.
